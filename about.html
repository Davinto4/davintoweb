    <section class="about-section">
      <p>It all began in <strong>September 2024</strong>, a month that would mark the start of an extraordinary self-taught journey.</p>
      <p><strong>Chimdindu Macdonald</strong>, known online as <strong>Davinto</strong>, became deeply curious about the world of web development. With no formal training, no mentor, and no paid course — just pure curiosity and determination — he began learning from scratch.</p>

      <p>He watched tutorials, studied code snippets, built mini-projects, and most importantly — failed a lot. But he didn’t stop. Every failure fueled him, and every bug fixed was a new lesson learned.</p>

      <p>Despite the early setbacks, his passion for building websites and digital experiences only grew stronger. From broken HTML pages to responsive and interactive websites, Chimdindu's skills evolved rapidly. What began as a humble experiment soon transformed into a powerful digital brand — <strong>DavintoWeb</strong>.</p>

      <p>Today, DavintoWeb stands as a testament to resilience, creativity, and the power of self-learning. It’s a digital platform where ideas become beautiful, responsive, functional websites — serving businesses, creators, and dreamers.</p>
