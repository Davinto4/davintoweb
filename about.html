    <h1>About DavintoWeb</h1>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Chimdindu Macdonald</strong>, widely known online by my pseudonym <strong>Davinto</strong>.
      My journey into the tech world began in September last year, fueled by curiosity and a burning desire to understand how websites are built and work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started with nothing but determination and self-teaching. I scoured YouTube videos, read tech blogs, and practiced building websites from scratch.
      In the beginning, I failed countless times — my code broke, my layouts were terrible, and my ideas often didn’t translate into real functioning sites.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I didn’t quit. I stayed up late, experimenting and debugging for hours. Over time, things started to click.
      I became well-grounded and confident in web development — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, hosting, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, all that hard work and sleepless nights led to the creation of <strong>DavintoWeb</strong> — a full-service platform to build clean, modern websites for clients, friends, and anyone with a vision.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      “I didn’t wait for the perfect time. I built my skills during the imperfect ones.”
    </p>

    <p>
      From total beginner to creator of a real web service — the journey wasn’t smooth, but it was worth it.
      And it’s just the beginning.
    </p>
